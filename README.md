# Hate Speech Recognition 

#### Overview

This project aimed to build a supervised learning model to predict if a sentence can be considered as containing hate speech or not using the available numerical features (text-related numerical features, latent coordinate features, sentiment scores).

-----

#### Software 
RStudio

-----


#### Result
Used 5 supervised learning methods: Classification Trees, Bagging using Classification trees, Boosting using Classification Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machine (Polynomial Kernel).

 Model tuning was performed on each method respectively and employed Train-Validation-Test Cross-validation to choose the optimal model.

-----

#### Data
Data contained text extracted from Stormfront, a white supremacist forum.

A random set of forum posts have been sampled from several subforums and split into sentences. Those sentences were manually labeled as containing hate speech or not, according to certain annotation guidelines.
